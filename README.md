# TexasVeteransEducationBenefits
2016 ATX Hack for Change
## Short description of the idea (140 character tweet):

_Explore finding a solution to simplify Texas veterans (and their family members) navigating their education benefits._

## What is your project concept or idea? What challenge or opportunity will it solve?

_Navigating the various educational benefits available to Texas veterans and their family members can be confusing and tricky. If we can alleviate stress caused by this process, they can focus on their studies and ultimately their academic and career goals._

## Who will benefit from your project? Describe the humans at the center of the problem - who are they? 
### How would they benefit? Can you tell their story?
### Do you have photos of them? Or quotes?

_This project would benefit military families, and ultimately our community. Education can help veterans make the transition into the civilian world, for instance._

## Issue area(s) relevant to your project idea:


- Education
- Veteran and military families

## What is the current state of your project idea?

I've done recent research related to veteran education benefits, but it's a very complex issue. Benefit information is on different websites, in addition to paperwork that must be filed by the veterans. I don't know if the government maintains some sort of updated database with information on the various benefits that could be accessed? That's one component I'm unsure where to find the answer for. I think it'd be great to form a team, and approach this with a design thinking methodology to see what we come up with.

## Tell us about yourself. 
### What is your background? Why is this challenge important to you? 
### Are you representing a group in submitting this project idea? 

_I'm a UX Designer and a military spouse. I worked on a similar project to this recently and interviewed veteran students. Even students with multiple degree still experienced stress and complications accessing their education benefits. The issue is also amplified with first-generation college students._
